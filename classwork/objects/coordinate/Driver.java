/* There are 3 different distance method called in the main method:
*  1. distance(point1, point2)
*  2. Point.distance(point1, point2)
*  3. point1.distanceTo(point2)
*  
*  For each of those methods respond the following questions:
*  1. Where is the method implemented (which class)? Justify your answer.
*  2. Is the method static or non-static? Justify your answer.
