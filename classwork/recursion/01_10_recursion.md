## Recursion with Strings

Implement the following methods and save them here: xx_recursion/Strings.java

### Print Characters

Print each character of the string.

What String method/s do you need?

What is the base case?

What is the recursive case?

Hint: an be solved using a head-and-tail algorithm, which consists of two parts:
  - printing the head of the string, and,
  - recursively printing its tail.


```
public static void printString(String word){

}
```

### Print the string backward

What String method/s do you need?

What is the base case?

What is the recursive case?

```
public static void printReverse(String word){

}
```

### Counting Characters in a String

Suppose you are writing an encryption program and you need to count the frequencies of the letters of the alphabet. Let’s write a recursive method for this task.

This method will have two parameters:

- word: string that will be processed
- ch: char to store the target character—the one we want to count.

The method should return an int, representing the number of occurrences of the target character in the string:

What String method/s do you need?

What is the base case?

What is the recursive case?

```
public static int countChar(String word, char ch) {

}

```
