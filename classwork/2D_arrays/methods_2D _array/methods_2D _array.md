## Methods 2D Arrays

- Create test cases in the main method to test the methods that you will implement.
  
- Include more than 1 test case for each method. Include different types of arrays, such as rectangular arrays, ragged arrays, empty arrays, etc.

### Method 1:
Write a method that prints a 2D array whith the following format:

```
"[[8, 4, 2], [1, 0, 9], [5, 7, 8]]"
```

```
public static void print(int[][] array)
{

}
```

### Method 2:

Write a method that return the sum of all the elements in the 2D array:

```
public static int findSum(int[][] array){

}
```

### Method 3:

Transpose a 2D array:

```
{{1,3,4},{2,4,3},{3,4,5}} ==> {{1,2,3},{3, 4, 4},{4,3,5}};
```

```
public static int[][] transpose(int[][] array){

} 
```
